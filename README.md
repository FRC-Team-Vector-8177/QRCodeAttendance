# QR Code Attendance
QR Code Attendance is a Python-based program that allows you to log attendance by showing a QR code to your webcam. It's logged in a generated JSON file.

# Installation
Download the latest release from this link: <br />
https://github.com/megalinee/QRCodeAttendance/releases

# Use
Once downloaded there will be two important files, admin.exe & camera.exe.<br />
admin.exe is used to enter in new members as well as get qr codes for existing members.<br />
camera.exe starts up active webcam scanning for QR codes. It will read the data and automatically log if a member is present or not.

To retrieve the data you just need the data.json file.<br />
For use of data within Google Sheets, I reccomend the following plugin for importing the JSON file:<br />
